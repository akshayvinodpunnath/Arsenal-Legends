        bio: "The Frenchman had exquisite technique, searing pace and surprising strength. And like the typical schoolboy superstar, he did pretty much everything for his team. Henry was the captain, the talisman, the dead-ball expert, the penalty-taker and the assist-maker. Then there's the goals, a club record 228 of them to be precise. And what a portfolio Henry built up during his eight years as Arsenal. Thumping drives, delicate chips, jinking runs, audacious backheels, even the odd header - the Frenchman had myriad ways to find the net."

        bio: `You could fill two pages with a list of the goals that had their genius in his vision. And you could fill a dictionary with a list of superlatives used to describe his 11-year career with Arsenal. Dennis Bergkamp is quite simply a legend of the game.

    In the last two decades many one-time unknowns have left Highbury with a fearsome reputation and much-warranted acclaim. But, in a way, Dennis was an exception; he came, and left, with a world-class calibre. ` },

        bio: `It was clear that Adams was a bit special from the moment he signed for Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1980. Three years later he made his debut against Sunderland, four weeks after his 17th birthday. It was hardly an auspicious start - Adams was partly to blame for a 2-1 home defeat - but he soon found his feet at the top level.
    
    By 1996 Adams was the England captain too but that year was dominated by revelations of his alcoholism. It proved a turning point on and off the pitch. Away from the action Adams matured and showed great dignity. On the field, the arrival of Wenger was perfectly timed. The Frenchman's focus on diet and preparation helped Adams fend off his old habits while Wenger's footballing ethos allowed the Arsenal skipper to express himself more on the pitch.` },
